**About Me**

I want to help others as much as possible. Currently, that means (1) doing AI research; (2) maxmizing the expected counterfactual impact of my donations. I'm particularly concerned about the importance, neglectedness, and tractability of artificial sentience.

I'm studying for a Bachelor's in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18x24Ke5Y-MAvti0AjoowCVwATXrfTEMA/view?usp=sharing)

**Research**

My  goal is to become a Principal Scientist of Scalable Alignment. Currently, I'm interested in goal misgeneralization, out of distribution detection, calibration, and honesty research on AI systems.

**Contact  Information**

You can contact me via email (qmot3@gatech.edu) or book a meeting with me on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/qmot/30min).

**Feedback**

If you have any feedback for me, I would love to receive it [here](https://forms.gle/FPc3gCz9KRsddHoV9). You can submit feedback anonymously or provide your contact information. I especially value strong, thoughtful criticism.
