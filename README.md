**About Me**

My name is Quentin Mot. I'm studying for a Bachelor's in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I want to use my career to help others as much as possible. Currently, that means doing AI Safety research.

You can contact me via email (qmot3@gatech.edu) or book a meeting with me on Calendly  (https://calendly.com/qmot/30min). You can find my CV <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/18x24Ke5Y-MAvti0AjoowCVwATXrfTEMA/view?usp=sharing>here<a>.
